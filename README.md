- Error handling and validation
- Secure password hashing
- Image conversion for optimized delivery

## Technologies Used
- Node.js

- MongoDB with Mongoose
- JWT for authentication
- Multer for file uploads
- bcryptjs for password hashing
- Express Async Handler for error management

## Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- MongoDB installed locally or MongoDB Atlas account
- npm or yarn package manager
